      "content": "Tourism has become a popular activity. Indeed, nowadays people travel more, and further, than they used to. The main reasons for tourism are: recreation, leisure and business. When travelling for recreation, people want to escape their stressful daily routine and to relax. Beach holidays are an example of such tourism. Business trips involve going to a distant place in order to settle business issues."

      "content": "Whether on a business trip or on a honeymoon, people want to explore the place they are in. They go on excursions, try new activities like diving or mountain climbing and learn about the historical background of the place and its cultural peculiarities. Sometimes they find out amazing facts about people and places and about themselves too! In fact, when people travel, they broaden their horizons."

Ecotourism is often misinterpreted as any form of tourism involving wildlife – but it's completely different from jungle tourism or safari. Eco-tourists are against disturbing the environment; even taking photos is not recommended. Take only memories and leave only footprints is a very popular slogan for them."

Planes pollute the air, which results in global warming. In fact, tourism is not harmless fun as many may think: new airports and tourist infrastructure, pollution and crowds of noisy tourists make wild animals migrate, which may decrease their population or even make them extinct."

To reduce the costs, avoid travelling in high season when flight tickets and hotels are overpriced. Remember that, along with expensive destinations, there are less prestigious but even more interesting places. When planning a trip, find out about low-cost airlines, discounts and special offers."

So, in 1802, French engineer Albert Favier was the first person who proposed to dig a tunnel under the water of the channel. Favier's plan was adopted by French leader Napoleon Bonaparte.

The greatest challenge was making sure that both the British side of the tunnel and the French side actually met up in the middle. Special lasers and surveying equipment were used. On December 1, 1990, the meeting of the two sides was officially celebrated. For the first time in history, Great Britain and France were connected."

He threw out the farmers from his land when they complained that the rents were too high. After that, the local shops refused to serve him, his servants left and the boy who delivered his mail disappeared too. The surname of the land agent became a word which means ‘silently ignoring somebody or something’. The word was adopted in English, French, Dutch, German, Russian etc."
